## netClasses

	** is it really a good idea to make the GraphClass remember its properties?

	* Check what np.full does
	* Mettre la fonction gen_fs au propre
	* Get the import from graph_tool clean
	* Check who owns what in terms of arrays and values (where are deepcopies necessary)

##Â IO
	* test other version of neighbout_list using lil and join

## GANET
	* transform all functions into the_dash_mode

## XmlHandler
    * check what Nico's soft is sending back as results
    * look at the Metropolis and GenAlg results versions
